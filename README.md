# Deep Learning for Automatic Modulation Classification

We propose an efficient and lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) for the task of automatic modulation classification (AMC). Before sending the received signal into our CNN model, we transform the signal to image domain with the proposed accumulated polar feature. It significantly improves the prediction accuracy and makes it more robust under fading channel. 
We provide the source code for the implementation of conventional approaches (Maximum Likelihood and Cumulant) and our deep learning based approaches. Hope this code is useful for peer researchers. If you use this code or parts of it in your research, please kindly cite our paper:
